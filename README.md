Clustering with PCA

## Resources
The resource I created about graph coloring in Python and how to detect outliers.
- [Graph Coloring in Python](https://github.com/fbenitachen/pdf-documentation/blob/main/Graph_Coloring_in_Python_Felice.pdf) - We can color the graph in Python freely as you wish, different from the templates by using colors in HTML code.
- [Detecting Outliers](https://github.com/fbenitachen/pdf-documentation/blob/main/Detecting_Outliers_Felice.pdf) - Detecting outliers in Python using visualization and statistics.
